# Airborne LiDAR Ground and Vegetation Classification

This repository contains pipelines for processing airborne and UAV-based LiDAR data, focusing on ground and vegetation classification using both traditional and deep learning methods.

## Main Technologies

[PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) - a lightweight PyTorch wrapper for high-performance AI research. Think of it as a framework for organizing your PyTorch code.

[Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) - a framework for elegantly configuring complex applications. The key feature is the ability to dynamically create a hierarchical configuration by composition and override it through config files and the command line.

## Project Structure

The directory structure of new project looks like this:
